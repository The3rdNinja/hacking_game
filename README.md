# hacking_game
a game that i started making and then i stoped bc someone already made this game and i thought it was new

thanks to Noam Koskas for the design.
I might miss a bit files but i dont think its that much of a problem.
if someone need to learn how to use pygame i recomand you go through the code. in the code there is lines of scrolling, pop-up messages, buttons-hover, other coll animitions
